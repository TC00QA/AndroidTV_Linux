## Where to source a box

You can source most boxes through marketplace, amazon or ebay. Make sure you are buying from a trusted seller as some sellers may advertise more RAM than the processor can actually support.

## What to look out for

As previously mentioned look out for misleading advertisments, as a rule of thumb the 4 main processors are as follows

### Amlogic S905*

The amlogic S905x3 is the best processor to go for, be very carful when looking for listings of the S905. The normal S905 can handle a max of 2GB DDR2/DDR3 ram. This by far is the worst choice if you are looking for enough ram. Performace of the S905 is nothing to be snuffed, however, for the same money you can buy the better S905x3. I would stick to the S905x3 for compatability. The S905x2 can be found but isnt as widely supported. The S905x3 is also perfect for machine learning as it has a built in NPU and NN Accelerator.


### Allwinner H6

The allwinner H6 is the older version of the H616. It sits somewhere performance wise inbetween the S905 and S905x3. This is a great chip if you can find it for cheaper. It supports up to 4GB of DDR3/DDR4 ram so should meet yours needs. Additionally this silicon also has a slightly better GPU if you need more graphical power.

### Allwinner H616

The H616 is a cheaper and more efficient version of the H6. It is a newer replacement and runs at a lower clockspeed to the H6 but performs the same. It also supports a higher resolution than the H6. I would reccomend the H6 over the H616 as the older model is better supported.

### Rockchip RK3318

If you are after raw GPU power this is definatley the chip to go for. With up to three times the GPU performance of the Amlogic S905x3 i would reccomend this if your are looking at running a GUI or will be doing GPU intensive tasks. What it makes up for in GPU horespower it lacks in CPU horepower. Yet again pushing the S905x3 to my most reccomended.

### Best performance

-- Best CPU and NPU:        S905x3
-- Better CPU and OK GPU:     S905
-- Best GPU and OK CPU:     RK3318
-- Best efficieny and support:  H6
